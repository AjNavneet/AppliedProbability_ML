Instead, you have to calculate it by looking at the area under a curve for a tiny range around that number. The likelihood of getting a number less than or equal to a certain value is determined by the \"cumulative distribution function\" or CDF. The \"percentage-point function\" or PPF gives you a specific number that's less than or equal to a given chance.\n",
