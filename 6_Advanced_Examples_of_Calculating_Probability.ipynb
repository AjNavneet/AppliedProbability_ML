        "Probability calculations can be tricky, and our brains tend to take shortcuts that lead to incorrect answers. To help you develop a better understanding of probability and overcome these challenges, let's explore some classic problems in applied probability. These problems, such as the birthday problem, boy or girl problem, and the Monty Hall problem, often deceive us with intuitive but wrong answers. To solve them, we need to apply the principles of marginal, conditional, and joint probability carefully.\n",

        "# Birthday Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "A classic example of applied probability involves calculating the probability of two people having the same birthday. It is a classic example because the result does not match our intuition. As such, it is sometimes called the **birthday paradox**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "How many people are required so that any two people in the group have the same birthday with at least a 50-50 chance?\n",
        "\n",
        "- There are no tricks to this problem; it involves simply calculating the marginal probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It is assumed that the probability of a randomly selected person having a birthday on any given day of the year (excluding leap years) is uniformly distributed across the days of the year, e.g. 1 or about 0.273%.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Our intuition might leap to an answer and assume that we might need at least as many people as there are days in the year, e.g. 365.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Our intuition likely fails because we are thinking about ourselves and other people matching our own birthday. That is, we are thinking about how many people are needed for another person born on the same day as you. That is a different question alltogether.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Instead, to calculate the solution, we can think about comparing pairs of people within a group and the probability of a given pair being born on the same day.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - This unlocks the calculation required. The number of pairwise comparisons within a group (excluding comparing each person with themselves) is calculated as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    comparisons = n × (n − 1) / 2\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "- For example, if we have a group of five people, we would be doing 10 pairwise comparisons among the group to check if they have the same birthday, which is more opportunity for a hit than we might expect.\n",
        "\n",
        "- One more step is required. It is easier to calculate the inverse of the problem. That is, the probability that two people in a group do not have the same birthday. We can then invert the final result to give the desired probability, for example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    P (2 in n same birthday) = 1 − P (2 in n not same birthday)\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "- We can see why calculating the probability of non-matching birthdays is easy with an example with a small group, in this case, three people.\n",
        "  - People can be added to the group one-by-one.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Each time a person is added to the group, it decreases the number of available days where there is no matching birthday in the year, decreasing the number of available days by one. For example 365 days, 364 days, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Additionally, the probability of a non-match for a given additional person added to the group must be combined with the prior calculated probabilities before it.\n",
        "    - For example `P (n = 2) × P (n = 3)`, etc. This gives the following, calculating the probability of no matching birthdays with a group size of three:\n",
        "\n",
        "      ```\n",
        "      P(n = 3) = (365 × 364 × 363) / (365 * 365 * 365)\n",
        "      ```\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Inverting this gives about 0.820% of a matching birthday among a group of three people.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Stepping through this, the first person has a birthday, which reduces the number of candidate days for the rest of the group from 365 to 364 unused days (i.e. days without a birthday).\n",
        "\n",
        "- For the second person, we calculate the probability of a conflicting birthday as 364 safe days from 365 days in the year or about a 99.72% probability of not having the same birthday.\n",
        "\n",
        "- We now subtract the second person’s birthday from the number of available days to give 363. The probability of the third person of not having a matching birthday is then given as 363 multiplied by the prior probability to give about 99.18%. This calculation can get tedious for large groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Therefore we might want to automate it. The example below calculates the probabilities for group sizes from two to 30.\n",
        "  - Running the example first prints the group size, then the available days divided by the total days in the year, then the probability of no matching birthdays in the group followed by the complement or the probability of two people having a birthday in the group.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The result is surprising, showing that only 23 people are required to give more than a 50% chance of two people having a birthday on the same day.\n",
        "  - More surprising is that with 30 people, this increases to a 70% probability.\n",
        "  - It’s surprising because 20 to 30 people is about the average class size in school, a number of people for which we all have an intuition (if we attended school).\n",
        "  - If the group size is increased to around 60 people, then the probability of two people in the group having the same birthday is above 99%!\n",

        "- It is another classical problem because the solution is not intuitive and in the past has caused great confusion and debate.\n",
        "  - Intuition for the problem says that there is a 1 in 3 or 33% chance of picking the car initially, and this becomes 1/2 or 50% once the host opens a door to reveal a goat.\n",
        "  - This is incorrect. We can start by enumerating all combinations and listing the unconditional probabilities. Assume the three doors and the user randomly selects a door, e.g. door 1.\n",

        "  - Our intuition suggests we remove the second case from the table and update the probability to 1/2 for each remaining case. This is incorrect and is the cause of the error. We can summarize our intuitive conditional probabilities for this scenario as follows:\n",

        "  - It means the host could not open the chosen door (door 1) or open a door with a car behind it. The host’s choice was dependent upon the first choice of the contestant and then constrained.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Another approach to solving this problem is to calculate the joint probability of the host opening doors to test the stay-versus-switch decision under both cases, in order to maximize the probability of the desired outcome.\n",

        "\n",
        "  - We can then calculate the joint probability of door 2 having the car and the host opening door 3. This is different because if door 2 contains the car, the host can only open door 3; it has a probability of 1.0, a certainty.\n",
        "\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    P (door2=car ∩ door3=open) = (1/3) × 1 = 0.333\n",

        "    ```\n",
        "    P (door1=car ∩ door2=open) = 0.166\n",
        "    P (door3=car ∩ door2=open) = 0.333\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "- Again, having chosen door 1 and the host opening door 2, the probability is higher that the car is behind door 3 (about 33%) than door 1 (about 16%). We should switch.\n",
        "  - If we are seeking to maximize these probabilities, then the best strategy is to switch. Again, in this example, we have seen how we can overcome our faulty intuitions and solve the problem both by enumerating the cases and by using conditional probability.\n",
